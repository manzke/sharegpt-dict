# sharegpt-dict
Playing with chatGPT to exploit other tools, which are using it.

One of the tools is sharegpt.com, which allows people to share their chats with chatGPT. 

sharegpt.com uses a pseudo-security with 7-digits ids.

Most of the code is generated by chatGPT.

800+ URLs have been "exploited". (mainly through the sitemap.xml ;))
